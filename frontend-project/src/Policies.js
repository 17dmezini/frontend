        <h1>Privacy Policies</h1>
<p>BY USING ANY OF OUR WEBSITES, PRODUCTS, OR SERVICES, YOU UNDERSTAND AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE WILL COLLECT AND USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION AS DESCRIBED IN THIS PRIVACY NOTICE. If you have questions, comments, or suggestions, you can always contact us using any of the ways described in the CONTACT US section.</p>

<h1>1. THE TYPES OF INFORMATION WE COLLECT, AND HOW WE COLLECT THEM</h1>

<p>We collect information from you, directly and through third parties, in accordance with this Privacy Notice any time you
 contact us, interact with us in person, through our services or on third-party platforms, or use our websites, products, or services.
  If you do not provide the information we request, we may not be able to provide our products or services to you.</p>

<h1>Personal Information</h1>

<p>Some of the information we collect can personally identify you, including, for example, your name and contact information, birthdate, government identification, payment information, payment arrangements, insurance arrangements, and information related to your rentals or use of products or services we provide or enable. For example, when you make a reservation, we collect your personal information such as your name and contact information; date of birth; driver license, and other appropriate government identification; payment information, including credit or debit card information (we collect security codes when you make a payment, but we do not keep them); and other information that may be necessary to rent you a vehicle, provide you with services, contact you about these services or verify your identity. If you participate in an insurance program through us or are involved in an accident or property damage, 
we may collect additional information about your insurance provider and/or coverage.</p>

<h1>Connected Car Data</h1>

<p>Some of our rental vehicles are connected cars. A connected car is a vehicle equipped with features, telematics systems, on-board devices, or built-in services and technologies that are capable of collecting data about the vehicle and its use, including, for example, the vehicle’s condition, damage and accident events and records, 
performance, operation and diagnostic data, information on mileage, acceleration, braking, speed, fuel consumption, fuel level, tire pressure, odometer, location and direction, and other vehicle-related information. Typically, this information is associated with the vehicle only and maintained as non-personal information, as described in the Non-Personal Information section below. If we link this information to you, we will treat it as personal information.
Use of features and built-in services and technologies in connected cars are subject to the terms and conditions posted by the vehicle manufacturer and/or the technology provider, which may include system and service limitations, warranty exclusions, limitations of liability, wireless service provider terms, and user responsibilities. Some or all of these features are turned on at all times, even when other services or other media in the vehicle are turned off.
Depending on the technology used in your rental vehicle, vehicle manufacturers and built-in services such as ‘Apple CarPlay’ or ‘OnStar’ may also collect Connected Car Data or other personal information from the vehicle pursuant to their privacy policies. For more information about this third-party information collection, please refer to the Third Party Collection section below.</p>

<h1>Location Information</h1>

<p>We may collect information about your location from our websites, your mobile devices, and your visits to our locations. You may opt out of our collection of information about your location from mobile devices at any time by turning off the transmission of geolocation data and push notifications on your mobile device.

We may also at times connect certain location-related Connected Car Data to you.</p>

<h1>Non-Personal Information</h1>

<p>We may also collect or transform information so that it is maintained in a form that is not linked to a particular individual, such as vehicle information that is not connected to a passenger or other aggregated, de-identified, or anonymized information.
 This Privacy Notice does not apply to non-personal information, which we collect, use, and disclose for a variety of purposes. 
 However, any non-personal information that is linked to or combined with personal information will be treated as personal information subject to this Privacy Notice.</p>
